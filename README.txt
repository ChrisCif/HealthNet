This is a django web aplication written for the Rochester Institute of Technology Introduction to Software Engineering class. The group spent the majority of the fall semester of 2016 to complete the project. Development began with requirements documentation in September of 2016 and ended with a "post-mortem" reflection in December of 2016. In that time, two releases were made as well as a beta release for Release 2. Furthermore, beta testing and cross-team testing were done to further assure quality control.
